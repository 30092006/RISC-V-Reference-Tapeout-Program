RTL Design Workshop: 5-Day Guide

Day 1: Introduction & Basic Verilog

Objective: Establish foundational knowledge of Verilog and RTL design.

Tasks:

1. Install Verilog simulation tools (Icarus Verilog, GTKWave).


2. Write a simple combinational circuit (2-to-1 multiplexer).


3. Create a testbench to verify functionality.


4. Simulate and observe waveforms.


5. Document challenges and observations.



Deliverable: A working multiplexer Verilog module with a verified testbench.


---

Day 2: Sequential Logic & Counters

Objective: Learn sequential design and basic timing concepts.

Tasks:

1. Design a 4-bit synchronous counter with enable and reset signals.


2. Implement a testbench with multiple scenarios:

Normal counting

Reset functionality

Enable/disable behavior



3. Simulate using waveform analyzer; verify all scenarios.


4. Add comments and timing diagrams for documentation.



Deliverable: Counter module with fully functional testbench and timing report.


---

Day 3: RTL Optimization & Modular Design

Objective: Practice writing reusable and optimized RTL modules.

Tasks:

1. Refactor the counter into a parameterized module (e.g., n-bit counter).


2. Combine multiple small modules into a top-level design (e.g., counter + decoder).


3. Optimize for minimal logic usage while keeping functionality.


4. Run simulations to ensure correctness after modular integration.


5. Record synthesis metrics like LUTs, flip-flops, and critical path delays.



Deliverable: Modular, parameterized RTL design with optimized logic utilization.


---

Day 4: RTL Synthesis & Timing Analysis

Objective: Translate RTL into gate-level design and analyze timing.

Tasks:

1. Set up synthesis flow using an open-source tool (Yosys or Vivado).


2. Synthesize the top-level design from Day 3.


3. Analyze synthesis report:

Number of gates

Maximum frequency

Propagation delay



4. Apply constraints (clock period, input/output delays) to meet timing.


5. Generate a gate-level netlist and compare simulation with RTL behavior.



Deliverable: Synthesis report, gate-level netlist, and verified timing analysis.


---

Day 5: Advanced Verification & Reporting

Objective: Verify overall design correctness and prepare professional documentation.

Tasks:

1. Develop an advanced testbench using assertions and random stimulus.


2. Check corner cases and boundary conditions.


3. Generate functional coverage reports to ensure all cases are tested.


4. Document the full workflow: RTL â†’ Simulation â†’ Synthesis â†’ Verification.


5. Prepare a GitHub-ready repository with organized files, README, and diagrams.



Deliverable: Fully verified RTL project with structured GitHub repository and complete documentation.
